## BovinoApp - Bovine Cattle Management

### Overview

BovinoApp is a project that utilizes the following technologies: Angular 11 and Spring Boot 4. It has been developed to assist in the management of operations related to a cattle farm.

2. **Login Page:** Provides secure authentication to access the system, ensuring that only authorized users can use the application.

3. **Dashboard Page:** Presents charts and general information about the livestock, including statistics, weight trends, and other essential data for farm management.

4. **Animal Page:** Lists all animals registered on the farm, allowing for quick viewing of individual details for each animal.

5. **Weight Evolution Page:** Displays the weight history of each animal, allowing for visual tracking of weight changes over time.
